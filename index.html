			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
			<blockquote>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless."</blockquote>
			<h1>Speaker of the Month</h1>

Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.</p>
